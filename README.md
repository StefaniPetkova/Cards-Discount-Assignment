# Cards-Discount-Assignment
As a beginning we are creating an abstract class because the other classes(Bronze, Silver,
Gold) contain the same variables and its easier to make a class that they all will inherit 
compared to writting three times the same variables and methods.
That way we are creating a higher level of abstraction.
We are making the variables private in order to have more security.
In the set methods we are ensuring that we wont enter invalid data.
We use abstract function to ensure that that function will provide implementation in the child
class.
We override method toString because we want it to show specific data.

In the main method we create objects from the three child classes and we are showing their
functionality.

A static method is a method that can be invoked without creating instance of a class.
